## How to run
* Install node.js (v17.6.0 is recommended) and npm
* Clone or download this repository
* Open a terminal and navigate to this project's main folder (which you downloaded in the last step)
* Run `npm i` to install the dependencies
* Create a file named `.envi`
* You must write the following in that file: `DISCORD_TOKEN=<your discord bot's token>` ([You have to create a discord bot first](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
* Now run `node .` to start the bot
## How to add stuff
The bot's settings are in the `config.js` file.

To add commands you just have to edit `commands.js`, you can use the already existing commands as an example.
